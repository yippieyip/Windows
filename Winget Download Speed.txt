Have you tried disabling Delivery Optimization and using the "normal" downloader? It's possible something gummed up on your machine that is making DO act funny.

    Run winget settings.
    In the JSON block that appears, add



"network": {
    "downloader": "wininet"
}



Now try a winget install and see if you have better results.
